## Introduction

The Keeper Notes App is a web application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. It was developed using React for the front-end hosted on Vercel and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the back-end hosted on Heroku. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing notes and is designed to be easy to use.

## Features

List the key features of your project. Bullet points are a great way to highlight each feature. For example:

- Feature 1: Users can create new notes by providing a title and content for the note.
- Feature 2: Users can easily delete notes that they no longer require. By clicking the delete button associated with a     
             note, it is permanently removed from the list of notes. This feature helps users declutter and manage their 
             notes efficiently
- Feature 3: The Keeper App is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes and devices, including                desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones
